# ScrapBook

A scrapbook project collecting the memories of Maryann and Bryant <3.

**How to update and add new pages into the scrap book**
1. Copy the templatepage.html and paste a copy of it.

2. Reanme the file to the correct page it is in the scrapbook. For example
page 7 will be named pageseven.html

3. Depending on which page number you are adding you will create a copy of an EVEN or ODD
CSS file. For instance if you are creating a page 7 then you will create a copy of the
scrapbookpageODDtemplate.css and rename it to scrapbookpage7.css

4. You will need to now update the css file linked in the HTML file. Open your new html page
at the top you will see the "Update css file here" comment. Change the number "2" to which ever page
number matches the page.

5. Now download and move your new images into the "imgs" folder. You will rename them such that the first number
is the page number and the second number stands for the picture number that it represents. For instance the first
image on page seven will be named "7-1.jpeg".

6. The rest of the HTML page will have comments on where you will need to update for the images and
text.

7. Depending on the sizes of the images there will be spacing issues that you will need to fix. I can help with that let me know
and I will walk you through that.
